The Yaci DevKit offers a customizable Cardano devnet that quickly launches and resets via the Yaci CLI, enabling faster
iterations for developers. It features Yaci Store, a lightweight indexer using H2, and Yaci Viewer, a browser-based interface for viewing transactions.
It supports flexible configurations, integrates with Ogmios and Kupo, and is compatible with Blockfrost API endpoints, all easily deployable
with Docker Compose for efficient setup.

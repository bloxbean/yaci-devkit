# Introduction

The Yaci DevKit offers a customizable Cardano devnet that quickly launches and resets via the Yaci CLI, enabling faster
iterations for developers. It features Yaci Store, a lightweight indexer using H2, and Yaci Viewer, a browser-based interface
for viewing transactions. It supports flexible configurations, integrates with Ogmios and Kupo, and is compatible
with Blockfrost API endpoints, all easily deployable with Docker Compose for efficient setup.

## Distribution Types

1. **Yaci DevKit (Docker) :** A Docker Compose-based distribution that includes all required components. This is the **recommended**
distribution for most users. Follow the installation instructions in [Yaci DevKit Docker page](/docker) to install Yaci DevKit.

2. **Yaci CLI Zip (Non-Docker):** A ZIP distribution that includes only Yaci CLI. This distribution is useful for users who
prefer to use Yaci CLI without Docker. With this distribution, you can download and manage required components like Cardano Node,
Ogmios, Kupo, and Yaci Store using Yaci CLI. For installation instructions, refer to the [Yaci CLI Installation](/yaci_cli_distribution) section.

3. **NPM Distribution**: You can also use Yaci Devkit and Yaci Viewer NPM distribution. For more information, check [NPM distribution](/yaci_cli_npm_distr) page.


**Important:**

<Callout>
In Yaci DevKit **v0.9.1-beta** and later, the Yaci CLI's native executable is the default. If you encounter issues starting DevKit,
you can switch back to the Java version by setting the **`yaci_cli_mode`** environment variable to **`java`** in the `config/env` file within
the Yaci DevKit installation directory."

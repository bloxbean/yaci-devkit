## Yaci DevKit NPM Distribution (0.10.0-preview5 and later)

For users who prefer npm, you can install Yaci DevKit using the `npm install` command. When installing from npm,
you need to install both the `yaci-devkit` and `yaci-viewer` packages separately.

## Supported Platforms

Like the non-Docker ZIP distribution, the npm distribution is currently supported on the following platforms:

1. **Linux x86**: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04
2. **macOS 14 (Arm64) or later**


## Installation

### Yaci DevKit Installation

```
npm i -g @bloxbean/yaci-devkit
```

### Yaci Viewer Installation

```
npm install -g @bloxbean/yaci-viewer
```

<Callout type="warning">
The following commands are used for the NPM distribution instead of the standard `devkit` or `yaci-cli` commands:

- **`yaci-devkit`**: Starts the Yaci CLI and other components.
- **`yaci-viewer`**: Starts the Yaci Viewer.

</Callout>

## Yaci DevKit - Commands

There is a new command, `up`, which handles both the download process and devnet creation.

### **Commands**

1. **Download and Start Cardano Node**

   ```bash
   yaci-devkit up
   ```
    - Downloads the Cardano node (if not already downloaded) and starts a new devnet.
    - You can pass other node-creation-specific arguments (same as the `create-node` command), such as --block-time or --port.

2. **Interactive Mode**

   If you want to interact with the running processes using `yaci-cli`, pass the `--interactive` option to the `up` command.

   ```bash
   yaci-devkit up --interactive
   ```
    - Downloads the node (if not already downloaded), starts a new devnet, and launches the `yaci-cli` prompt.

3. **Yaci Store Mode (Blockfrost-Compatible API Endpoints)**

   ```bash
   yaci-devkit up --enable-yaci-store
   ```
    - Downloads and starts the Cardano node, Yaci Store, and Ogmios (used for script cost evaluation).
    - Add `--interactive` to enter the `yaci-cli` prompt.

4. **Kupomios Mode (Ogmios + Kupo)**

   ```bash
   yaci-devkit up --enable-kupomios
   ```
    - Downloads and starts the Cardano node, Ogmios, and Kupo.

For a full list of Yaci CLI commands, check the Yaci DevKit [documentation](/commands).

## Yaci Viewer Commands

Once the Yaci DevKit DevNet with yaci-store support is running, you can run Yaci Viewer using `yaci-viewer` command.

```bash
yaci-viewer
```

By default, Yaci Viewer connects to a Yaci-Store backend running on `localhost` at port `8080`.


### Configuration Options

If you need to connect to a Yaci-Store backend running on a different host or port, you can configure Yaci Viewer in one of the following ways:

#### Option 1: Using a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the same directory where you are starting Yaci Viewer, and specify the following environment variables:

- `PUBLIC_INDEXER_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the indexer API. Default: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`.
- `PUBLIC_INDEXER_WS_URL`: The WebSocket URL for live updates. Default: `ws://localhost:8080/ws/liveblocks`.

#### Option 2: Using Command-Line Arguments

You can also specify the indexer base URL and WebSocket URL directly via command-line arguments:

```bash
yaci-viewer --indexerBaseUrl http://new-url.com/api/v1 --indexerWsUrl ws://new-url.com/ws/liveblocks
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the YaciDevKit or Yaci-Store backend is running and accessible before starting Yaci Viewer.
